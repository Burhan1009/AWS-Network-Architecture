# AWS-Network-Architecture
This project showcases a cloud infrastructure with public subnets for frontend/admin, private subnets for databases (MySQL, Oracle, DocumentDB), and a separate VPC for testing (Ansible, RDP). It uses NAT Gateway and VPC Peering for secure communication

## üß∞ Technologies & Services

- **AWS VPC**
- **Subnets (Public & Private)**
- **Internet Gateway**
- **NAT Gateway**
- **Route Tables**
- **Security Groups & NACLs**
- Terraform / AWS CLI (if applicable)

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Create a VPC with a customizable CIDR block  
‚úÖ Provision public & private subnets in multiple AZs  
‚úÖ Set up Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway for internet access  
‚úÖ Configure route tables & security groups  
‚úÖ Easy-to-follow steps or IaC (Infrastructure as Code)<br/>
‚úÖ Setup VPC Peering

## üåê 1Ô∏è‚É£ VPC Only
- In this option, your project focuses only on building the networking layer (VPC).
  You create and configure just the VPC and its networking components.

### What‚Äôs included
- VPC
- Subnets (public & private)
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway
- Route Tables
- Security Groups
- Network ACLs

#### This option is good if
- You just need to prepare a secure, scalable network foundation.
- Application, EC2 instances, databases, and other services will be deployed later by someone else
- You want to showcase expertise in AWS networking only.

## üåê 2Ô∏è‚É£ VPC and More
- In this option, your project goes beyond the VPC itself and also provisions other AWS resources (compute, storage, etc.)   that run inside the VPC..

### What‚Äôs included
- Everything in VPC Only, plus
- EC2 Instances (in public or private subnets)
- RDS/Databases (in private subnets)
- Application Load Balancers
- Auto Scaling Groups
- S3 Buckets
- IAM roles & policies

#### This option is good if
- You‚Äôre building a complete, end-to-end infrastructure ready to run workloads.
- You want to demonstrate full-stack AWS cloud deployment skills

## IPv4 CIDR Block | IPv4 CIDR | IPv6 CIDR block | Tenancy | Tags

### üìÑ VPC Configuration: Description
This VPC is configured with a custom IPv4 CIDR block and an identifying name tag for easy management and visibility.
- ‚úÖ The Name tag (TechD-VPC) is applied to the VPC resource to help distinguish it from other VPCs in the AWS account. Tags in AWS are key-value pairs you can use to organize, search, and track resources effectively.
- ‚úÖ The IPv4 CIDR block is manually specified as 111.125.251.0/28.
- This defines the range of private IPv4 addresses available in this VPC.
- A /28 CIDR block supports 16 total IP addresses, out of which 11 are usable for resources like EC2 instances, NAT Gateway, etc.
- The small size (/28) suggests this VPC is designed for testing, demonstration, or small-scale workloads.
- ‚úÖ The tenancy is set to default, which allows your EC2 instances and other resources to run on shared hardware.
- Hardware like Cisco Router , Juniper, Nokia, Cisco Switch etc
- ‚úÖ A tag is added with key Name and value TechD-VPC to help identify the resource in the AWS console or CLI.

## üå©Ô∏è AWS VPC: TechD-VPC
This project creates a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS with a clearly defined IPv4 CIDR block and name tag for easy identification.
It lays the foundation for deploying cloud resources in an isolated and secure environment.

```shell | Property           | Value                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| **VPC Name (tag)** | TechD-VPC                       |
| **VPC ID**         |          |
| **IPv4 CIDR Block**| 111.125.251.0/28               |
| **IPv6 CIDR Block**| Not configured                 |
| **Tenancy**        | Default (shared hardware)      |
```
